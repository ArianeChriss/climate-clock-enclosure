# climate-clock-enclosure
Enclosure design files for the portable versions of the climate clock at https://climateclock.world/make

# Notes:
**The .dxf files need to be updated with slightly smaller holes for the screws, and we're still in the process of testing the printed pieces with heat set inserts instead of nuts. Check back here for updates!!!**

# Materials:
24 M3x8 screws (I use socket cap screws)

24 M3 hex nuts

3d printer filament

2 pieces of 1/8" material for laser cutting, minimum dimensions 27.75"x6" each

# Instructions:
1. Print all .stl files (part modeled in inches, if ridiculously small in print software scale by 2540%)
    center_1.stl
    center_2.stl
    case.stl
    end.stl
2. Laser cut all .dxf files (also designed in inches, dimensions should be 27.75” x 6”)
    front_cut.dxf
    back_cut.dxf
3. Use M3 hex nuts as heat-set inserts, set on top of holes in 3d printed parts, apply soldering iron (set to at least 315℉) and press gently to allow nut to settle into hole

4. Center matrix displays on front laser cut piece
5. Place Raspberry Pi and HAT into case, use M3 x 8 screws to attach case, end and center pieces to front laser cut piece
6. May need to snip small plastic tabs off of display molding, depending on which displays are used
7. Attach all power and display cables
8. Use M3 x 8 screws to attach back laser cut piece
